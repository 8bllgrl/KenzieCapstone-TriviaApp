        This quiz game will test your knowledge!
        See if you have what it takes to answer as many questions as you can. For each question you get correct,
        your score will go up. If you don't answer correctly, your score will not rise.

        Now the quiz question amount can be changed more easily!
        Instead of going into the quiz class to change the number of questions, simply input the amount of
        questions you desire.

        NOTE:
        Took some advice from my teacher and tried to shorten my constructor code by turning some actions into methods.
        I hope this looks better as an object-oriented program now :)
        The reason I made this quiz in a separate method like this is i was preparing myself to add visuals.
        That didn't seem to happen. I'll add visuals if necessary.
